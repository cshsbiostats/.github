# Cedars-Sinai Biostatistics Shared Resources
Welcome to the GitHub page of the Cedars-Sinai Biostatistics Shared Resources. Our department is dedicated to advancing research through innovative statistical methodologies and software development. Here, you will find a collection of software tools and packages developed by our team.

**[Escalation With Overdose Control (EWOC)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ewoc/index.html)** - Tools for Phase I Dose Finding Clinical Trials as a CRAN-R package.

**[Treatment Tolerability](https://cshsbiostats.github.io/breast-cancer-symptom-explorer)** – Interactive web-based data visualization program. Developed using R and the Shiny web application to display numerical and graphical summary statistics of treatment tolerability and QOL over time in cancer patients. Source code can be found here.

**[Adverse Events](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/visae/index.html)** – Visae CRAN-R package using stacked correspondence analysis method to visualize the associations between cancer treatments and AEs while controlling the loss of information due the dimension reduction of the toxicity space. The tool displays biplots to explore differences in AE data among different treatments in clinical trials.

**Treatment Discontinuation Risk with [Anastrozole](https://cshsbiostats.shinyapps.io/risk_anastrozole/) or [Tamoxifin](https://cshsbiostats.shinyapps.io/risk_tamoxifen/)** – Novel web applications to estimate the risk of treatment discontinuation in breast cancer patients. Uses dynamic risk prediction models where the clinician inputs a patient’s baseline body mass index (BMI), selected PRO symptoms collected over time up to 6 or 12 months, and requests the probability that the patient will stop treatment by a pre-specified time in the future.
